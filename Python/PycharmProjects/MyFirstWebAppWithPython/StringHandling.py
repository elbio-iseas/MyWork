# String manipulation methods
# Remember, string type is IMMUTABLE in Python too.

# capitalize() capitalizes the first character of the string content
str_obj = "python, is an easy programming language."

# casefold() changes all capital letter to lower case
another_str = "Python Is A Multiple Inheritance Language."
print(another_str.casefold())

# center(30) return the string object centered in the 30 blanks
title = "Python miracle"
print(title.center(30))

# count() returns how many times "the" is in the string "text"
text = "In the world of Python programming the indentation is strict."
print(text.count("the"))

# encode() encodes the string object content.
quote = "In Python you don't need a ; at the end of each statement."
print(quote.encode())

# endswith() returns True or False depending on the last character parameter of the string
str_txt = "In Python the variable type is determine by its content!"
