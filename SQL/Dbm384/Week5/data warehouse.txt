"A Data warehouse is a relational database that is designed for query and analysis rather than for transaction processing." Companies take advantage of data warehouses to perform analysis on data and on transactions history. A data warehouse uses ETL techniques, OLAPs engines, Analysis tools and various application tools to help company decision makers use information resulting from this database. 

In comparison with an OLTP, Data Warehouses use:
a) multidimentional data structures
b) many indexes
c) some joins
d) duplicated data ( with denormalized databases)
e) derived data an aggregates

while an OLTP uses:
a) complex data structures
b) a few indexes
c) many joins
d) normalized databases
e) rarely derived data and aggregates
