In an article of Tony Patton from www.techrepublic.com about determining when to use stored procedures versus sql statements, he states that the decision of using one option or another depends on the user, but with stored procedures which can be called by a user or by an application or another stored procedure there are some benefits:
* modularity
* faster execution
* network traffic reduction
* security mechanism use
Also stored procedures can receive input parameters for processing transactions and even return values as output parameters to the invoking procedure. We can determine if the transactions in the stored procedure finished successfully or if it had erros (with the reasons why it failed). Stored procedures can be executed from memory later than the first time it was ran.
Example of stored procedure with SELECT statement:
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.Address_Customer_Show
AS
SELECT cst.FirstName,
                cst.LastName,
                adr.Street,
                cty.Name AS City,
                stat.Name AS State,
                adr.ZipCode
FROM Address AS adr
INNER JOIN City AS cty
            ON adr.City = cty.CityID
INNER JOIN State AS stat
            ON adr.State = stat.StateID
INNER JOIN Customer AS cst
            ON adr.CustomerID = cst.CustomerID
GO
EXEC dbo.Address_Customer_Show                
                                                                  References
