No, I am not using USE to create a database, just CREATE DATABASE DBM296_Iseas as the individual assignment was asking to to. The problem is that when run a script that creates the database, the schemas, the tables, the primaries, and foreign keys and it gives me some errors, it created the tables and the primary and foreign keys, I delete the database with the SSMS to try again but it deletes the database but not the keys, so when I try again it gives me error saying the the object for instance customers, it says that there is an object with that name. It is very frustrating to get stopped by that. I am doing it now with Visual Studio 2015, and it is very good because I can see the SQL code Visual Studio uses to create the objects. It is different from other methods mentioned in books. There are different ways of doing the same. Don't think I don't know how to create a database, schemas, tables, primary, and foreign keys. It is just that SQL Server does not like the way I am doing it but I follow what the books say. I use three books: this class chapters, Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Step by Step (Mike Hotek), and Apress SQL Server 2005 T-SQL Recipes A Problem-Solution Approach (Joseph Sack). SQL from Visual Studio 2015 seems to be working. By looking at my script we can see that the syntax is right but may be my problem is trying to create everything at the same time. One thing for sure, I am doing my best to make it to work.
