Filegroups offer the chance to store data files in different locations or drives. There is another file extension (.ldf) for transaction logs.

Access Restriction controls what users can access a database and when. There are three modes of access restriction:
1) Multi_User - for any authorized user to connect and use the database. This is the default mode.
