In SQL staments there are four functions to handle NULL values. These functions can be used in SELECT commands to work with or without NULL values. 
A NULL value is a value representing nothing. There are columns in which we can allow NULL values, like for instance phone number columns that we yet do not
know the number so it can be entering at a later time. In other cases NULL are not allowed, for instance columns that represent primary or foreign keys. 
This is a good way to find columns with NULL values, or to filter those rows with columns different than NULL values. By using the command SELECT we can
work with the clause WHERE name of column IS NULL/IS NOT NULL to select rows with NULL or different from NULL column values.

Example: SELECT * FROM Customers
         WHERE MobileNumber IS NULL;

This statement will group all the rows with the column MobileNumber with value NULL from the table Customers.

Example: SELECT * FROM Payroll
         WHERE OvertimeHours IS NOT NULL;

On this statement the result rows will be those in which the column OvertimeHours values are different from NULL. This way it is easy to browse employees that
worked overtime.

There is a function called NULLIF that tests two columns or expressions and it returns a NULL value if the expressions/columns are the same. In case the expressions 
are not equal, it returns the first expression.

COALESCE returns the first value not NULL in a list of values/columns/expressions.
