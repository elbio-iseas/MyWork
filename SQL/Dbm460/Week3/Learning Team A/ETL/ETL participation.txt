                     The impact of requirements on architecture
					 
ETLs demand a great deal of time if we want to avoid crashes at loading time. 
The first step on ETL processes is Data Extraction. We have to consider internal
and external data sources taking into account compatibility of Operating Systems,
data structures. All methods and procedures used for data extraction need to be
documented.

The second step is Data Transformation. In order to prepare data to be ready for 
loading, data go through several functions like filtering, normalization or 
denormalization, aggregation, conversion to the right column type, and verification
of values correct so there are no mismatch errors when loading.

The third step is Data Loading. It starts by defining the initial load. The time of 
the day when the loading will occur needs to be planned, how many loads per day, also
determine the frequency of loads: daily, weekly, monthly.
